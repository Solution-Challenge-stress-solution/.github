## Motivation

According to SBS News, the number of depression patients in Korea exceeded 1 million in 2022, and in KBS News, one in four elementary, middle, and high school students are considering extreme choices like suicide due to academic stress. 

In addition, Korea is a highly competitive society, so young students to adults are suffering from burnout syndrome. Because of the social atmosphere that considers enduring to be a virtue, many people do not even recognize their feelings and stress accurately.

As mental health has become a serious concern in Korean society, we felt the need for an app that could present people’s emotions and stress with precise indexes and manage them.
