# STREcording

Record your story, Discover your emotion and stress


## 🔥 Motivation

Mental health has become a significant concern in Korea. According to SBS News, the number of depression patients in Korea exceeded 1 million in 2022, and in KBS News, one in four elementary, middle, and high school students are considering extreme choices like suicide due to academic stress. 

The highly competitive nature of Korean society contributes to a widespread experience of burnout syndrome among young students to adults. Because of the social atmosphere that considers enduring to be a virtue,  many individuals do not even recognize their feelings and stress accurately.

As mental health has become a serious concern in Korean society, we felt the need for an app that could present people’s emotions and stress with precise indexes and manage them.
